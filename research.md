### Reconsidering Dynamic Systems in Light of Irregularity

This work was my Williams College computer science honors thesis, advised by Duane Bailey. We investigated biologically inspired spatially irregular cellular automata to determine the conditions of emergent computation and graceful degradation.

My full thesis can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://unbound.williams.edu/theses/islandora/object/studenttheses%3A79).

A draft of our work presented at the Conference of Complex Systems 2017 can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pdfs/ireg-paper-draft.pdf).
