Game Jam Winter 2015:
A fun coding challenge I participated in January 2015. 
The goal was to create a fully functioning game within 48 hours.
I chose to write in Javascript, primarly using the Codeheart.js game API.
The game can be played at: http://tliu526.github.io/game_jam_winter_2015/play.html
