Machinis Ludo Game Jam Winter 2015:
A fun coding challenge I participated in January 2015. 
The goal was to create a fully functioning game within 48 hours.

The end result is Soundscape! Soundscape is a simple side scrolling platformer, with an added twist of music beat detection contributing to gameplay.

I chose to write in Javascript, primarly using the Codeheart.js game API. WebAudiox.js is used for the audio processing.

Soundscape can be played at: http://tliu526.github.io/game_jam_winter_2015/play.html
