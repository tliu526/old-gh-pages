### Machinis Ludo Game Jam Winter 2015
A fun coding challenge I participated in January 2015.
The goal was to create a fully functioning game within 48 hours.

The end result is Soundscape! Soundscape is a simple side scrolling platformer, with an added twist of music beat detection contributing to gameplay.

I chose to write in Javascript, primarly using the Codeheart.js game API. WebAudiox.js is used for the audio processing.

Soundscape can be played [here]({{site.baseurl}}/game_jam_winter_2015/play.html)
